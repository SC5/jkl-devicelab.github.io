      <h2 class="major"><span>What is an Open Device Lab anyway?</span></h2>

      <p>An open device lab is a collection of mobile phones, tablets
        and other devices that people can use to access the
        Internet. The devices are provided
        by <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">the community</a>, for
        the community, to help everyone have access to a range of
        devices for testing their websites and apps.</p>

      <h3>Why have it?</h3>

      <p>Testing websites across different platforms and devices helps
        ensure the sites are accessible and functional, no matter how
        people access them. Same goes for testing your app over all
        device and operating system versions. With the growing number
        of devices and form factors, it can be challenging and costly
        to maintain an up-to-date collection for testing. That’s where
        the device lab comes in.</p>

      <h3>Who can use it?</h3>

      <p>The lab is open to anyone who needs it to test their web or
        app projects: developers, startups, students, you name it. All
        you need to do is <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> with us
        and schedule a time to come in.</p>

      <h3>Who’s behind it?</h3>
